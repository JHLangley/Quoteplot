# Quoteplot

## Introduction
Quoteplot is a simple economics interface as an experiment into technical analysis to build a better understanding of the wide range of technical indicators that are available aswell as experiment in the realm of software engineering. The brief of this project was undertaken due to it's easy of access as it is possible to start on high latency systems with only one or two technical indicators available. Thus improving both an understanding of large time series data but hopefully a larger humbling understanding of finance and economics as a whole.

Later aims include to implement a range of ML and BD techniques to provide more advanced albeit slower analysis as well as experiment in the realm of BLOB streaming. Due to the modularity of the domain space this was an ideal domain for me to begin experimenting with python in a meaningful way. Hopefully this will further my understanding of software development and appreciate some of the more tedious necessary tasks and available packages to tackle these issues.

### Sprints
#### Sprint 1
* Provide a simple graph non-interactive interface which can display arbitrary historical stock quotes in 1 day buckets.
* Implement arbitrary SMA windows and overlay onto the quote.
* Implement 1 version of S and R analysis.
